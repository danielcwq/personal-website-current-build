                        Running can, and should be, fun. Chances are, if you hate running, you're overexerting yourself.
                        Sometimes, it takes more discipline to slow down, because training smart is not always about pushing yourself to the limit.

                        <p> It has been a long journey of self-discovery for me. Over the years, as I've accumulated more knowledge about how my body responds to different workouts, I've started writing 
                            tutorials and coaching others on an ad-hoc basis. (for free)

                            While I'm not IAAF qualified, I've coached working professionals and JC students to help achieve PBs in their 2.4km IPPT run, as well as other events up to the 10km. 
                            I've added an article that I wrote on getting good at the 2.4km distance (top Google search result for 2.4km training plan), as well as links to Twitter threads that I've created about 
                            sports science and running.
